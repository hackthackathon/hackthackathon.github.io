## Motivation and rationale
Time-bounded events such as hackathons, hackweeks, data dives, codefests, edit-a-thons, and others have become a common form of collaboration in various domains. Scientific communities and civic communities in particular have embraced them as opportunities for researchers to acquire skills that are useful for their work and to form collaborations within their disciplines and beyond. In recent years, practitioners and researchers have acquired significant (practical) knowledge organizing and studying hackathon events. However, our understanding of motivations and best practices is largely limited to single domains and remains siloed. What is currently missing is a higher-level view of the common motivations, goals, and best practices for scientific hackathons. Similarly, it is instructive to uncover and understand differences between how different communities organize events in relation to their goals.

Our understanding of both short-term and long-term outcomes is also still very limited: in what contexts are hackathons useful? Are there concrete outcomes we can and should measure, possibly across domains? What instruments should we use to measure them? How can we organize an event to foster specific outcomes? There is little exchange of knowledge between organizers and researchers of different domains leading to a fragmentation of knowledge and potential costly repetition of common mistakes. This fragmentation inhibits progress: grand challenges requiring the collaboration of individuals from different disciplines remain unaddressed.
